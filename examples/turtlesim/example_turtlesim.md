# Example - TurtleSim
This is an example using the simplest possible 'robot' in the ROS ecosystem: TurtleSim! 

Turtlesim is a lightweight simulator for learning ROS / ROS 2. It illustrates what ROS does at the most basic level to give you an idea of what you will do with a real robot or a robot simulation later on.

To make things simple, this example includes a docker container with ROS 2 and turtlesim preinstalled to enable you to jump straight into testing the MCP server without needing to learn the dependencies of ROS.
